# Project 2 Proposal
##### Brendan Frisby

### Project Choice

I'm choosing to create a real time messaging application.

### Project Description

I'm making a simple messaging application using Socket.io, Express, Node and MongoDB.

My fall back would be a forum without socket.io

### Wire Frames

### User Stories

As a user I'd like to be able to sign in or register, at a minimum add any names for who's in the chat.
Users want to know when the other person disconnects from the chat.
Users want the incoming/outgoing messages to show who sent it correctly, if that's myself it should say "You: followed by any text I have sent".
A user wants a way to end the chat.
A user wants a option to create new chat rooms or switch rooms.

### MVP

Minimum I want the following

- Add each persons name to the chat when it starts.
- Show both sides when someone disconnects from the chat.
- A way to end the chat.
- Create new chat rooms.

### Stretch Goals

- A system to register users and sign in users
- A timeout where messages sent will delete themselves from the thread
- Some type of animation or sound when messages are sent.
