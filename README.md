### User Stories

As a user I'd like to be able to sign in or register
I want to see when a message was sent and by who
User wants to be able to edit a previous post
A user wants to be able to delete a post
A user wants a option to create new threads

### MVP

Minimum I want the following

- CRUD on any posts
- Ability to create new threads
- Ability to sign in
- CRUD on Users/Registration

### Stretch Goals

- A system to register users and sign in users
- Some type of animation or sound when messages are sent.
- Bcrypt hashed passwords for storage
- Try using socket.io or another npm only if I've completed everything else
